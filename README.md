# Payroll-PLSQL-Automation
A Payroll Management System in SQL and PL/SQL that automates salary calculation based on attendance and leave. Built a normalized schema with stored procedures and bulk net‑pay functions. Added row‑level triggers to enforce leave thresholds by issuing warnings or deducting salary.
